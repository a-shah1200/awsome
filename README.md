## Virualization
- Client install
- Hypervisor install

## Problem
- in old days , we used to have single hardware, in which single os is installed & all the data is present on that hardware.
& also we had to create backup of data because if the os fails or the harware then we had get a new hardware & install new os & backup all the data into it. takes time & money.

## client install
- Vmware
- Hardware - os - Vmware (app) - x1 ,x2 ....xn os.
- Now , get a hardware , install os in it & then Vm ware & install os on it. if the base os fails or the hardware then just cut the vm ware os and paste it another hardware.
- Hardware allocation happens in your own computer.


## Hypervisor install
- seperates os & hardware.
- hypervisor (hardware) install exsi.(not a os but just ip address given on screen)
- another computer  & install V-Sphere & connect to hypervisor(esxi) & able to manages all the hypervior & install virtual machines. 
- Harware allocation happens in exsi (hypervisor).
